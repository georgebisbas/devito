Example runs:

* `python3 run_advisor.py --name isotropic --path <path-to-devito>/examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py`
* `python3 run_advisor.py --name tti_so8 --path <path-to-devito>/examples/seismic/tti/tti_example.py --exec-args "-so 8"`
* `python3 run_advisor.py --name iso_ac_so4 --path <path-to-devito>/benchmarks/user/benchmark.py --exec-args "bench -P acoustic -so 4 --tn 200 -d 100 100 100"`

After the run has finished you should be able to plot a roofline with the results and export roofline data to JSON using:
* `python3 roofline.py --name Roofline --project <advisor-project-name>`

To create a read-only snapshot for use with Intel Advisor GUI, use:
* `advixe-cl --snapshot --project-dir=<advisor-project-name> pack -- /<new-snapshot-name>`

Prerequisites:
* Support is guaranteed only for Intel Advisor as installed with Intel Parallel Studio v 2020 Update 2
  and Intel oneAPI 2021, 2022, 2023; earlier versions may not work.

* In Linux systems you may need to enable system-wide profiling by setting:

```sh
/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 0
/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to 1
```

* `numactl` must be available on the system. If not available, install using:
  ```bash
	sudo apt-get install numactl
  ```
* Install `pandas` and `matplotlib`. They are not included in the core Devito installation.

Limitations:

* Untested with more complicated examples.
* Untested on Intel KNL (we might need to ask `numactl` to bind to MCDRAM).
* Running the `tripcounts` analysis takes a lot, despite starting in paused
  mode. This analysis, together with the `survey` analysis, is necessary to
  generate a roofline. Both are run by `run_advisor.py`.
* Requires Python3, untested in conda environments
* Currently requires download of repository and running `pip3 install .`, the scripts
  are currently not included as a package with the user installation of Devito

TODO:

* Give a name to the points in the roofline, otherwise it's challenging to
  relate loops (code sections) to data.
* Emit a report summarizing the configuration used to run the analysis
  (threading, socket binding, ...).
